                <hr>
                <p class="introText">Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the
                    World Wide Web, taking
                    place
                    at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true
                    data
                    ownership as well as improved privacy.

                <h2>What does Solid offer?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building
                    decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible
                    and
                    it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At a glance, here is what Solid offers...</p>

                    <h3>True data ownership</h3>
                    <p>Users should have the freedom to choose where their data resides and who is allowed to access it.
                        By
                        decoupling content from the application itself, users are now able to do so.</p>

                    <h3>Modular design</h3>
                    <p>Because applications are decoupled from the data they produce, users will be able to avoid vendor
                        lock-in, seamlessly switching between apps and personal data storage servers, without losing any
                        data or social connections.</p>

                    <p>Developers will be able to easily innovate by creating new apps or improving current apps, all
                        while
                        reusing existing data that was created by other apps.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The success of the Solid project has led to some new exciting developments to help it gain broad
                    worldwide adoption.</p>
                <h3>Inrupt</h3>
                <p>We are pleased to note that a new start-up, Inrupt, Inc, will be putting its own effort into the
                    Solid
                    open source technology and the Solid movement.</p>
                <p>Inrupt is building a commercial ecosystem to fuel Solid’s success and protect the integrity of the
                    next
                    phase of the web. Its mission is to restore rightful ownership of data back to every web user and
                    unleash a new wave of innovation - for developers, for business, for everyone.</p>
                <p>Read Tim's open letter to the community about Solid and Inrupt.</p>
                <h3>Solid Community Site</h3>
                <p>The best resource for all things Solid is now the Solid Community Site.</p>
                <p>There you will find regular community updates, a wealth of developer resources, and general
                    information
